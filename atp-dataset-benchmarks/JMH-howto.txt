After creation of aggregation pom
you can use command:
mvn archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false -DarchetypeGroupId=org.openjdk.jmh -DarchetypeArtifactId=jmh-java-benchmark-archetype -DgroupId=org.sample -DartifactId=test -Dversion=1.0
to generate a JMH module from archetype
as described in http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/

benchmark samples is here: http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/a128fd4a5901/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/

Now we have module for benchmark tests.
We should add dependencies to our production modules to be able to write tests and pack an uberjar with our production modules plus jmh itself.
It is the recommended approach.

After packaging of benchmarks module we've got the target/benchmarks.jar which has no dependencies.
We can copy it to the different environments, run and collect data.
The run command is like:
java -jar target/benchmarks.jar -rf json
see JMH-run.cmd
